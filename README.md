# Simple Audio Mixer Overlay
A simple volume overlay I built for use with my XP-PEN tablet buttons and wheel.

This uses the WIN32 API so will only work on Windows, tested on Windows 10.
I want to eventually rebuild this in C++ with a dedicated process to listen for a key combo to open the mixer.

## Setup

### 1. Install dependecies
I included a "dependecies.txt" with all the required python modules. You can install them with `pip install -r dependencies.txt`.

### 2. (Optional) Build into an EXE using pyinstaller or similar.
I included a "build.bat" file for wrestling the python app into a semi portable EXE in "./bin". That makes the next step easier.

### 3. AutoHotKey
I included the AutoHotKey script I use for opening the overlay. You can find AutoHotKey here: https://www.autohotkey.com/
I personally compiled the script into an EXE and put a shortcut to it in my windows Startup folder.
You can compile an AutoHotKey script by right clicking the script in file exploror, and clicking "Compile Script".
You can find your startup apps folder by pressing Win+R and entering "shell:startup".

### 4. Key Bindings for your drawing tablet or other input device.
For my XP-PEN Artist 12 Pro, I set each button to select a volume slider, and I set the wheel to turn the volume up and down.
The target application is set to the EXE created by pyinstaller in step 2.

The monitor you want the overlay to display on, starting at 0 or monitor 1.

### `button_count` or `control_count`
- Type: Integer
- Default: 8
The amount of buttons your device has, in the case of my Artist 12 Pro drawing tablet, I have 8.

### `close_on_deselect`
- Type: Boolean
- Default: True

A list of steam library folder paths.

### `steam_game_cache_timeout`
- Type: Integer
- Default: 7200
In minutes, the amount of time it takes for the steam game cache to be invalidated.
NOTE: The steam game cache is also the index the overlay uses for determining if an app is a steam game.
Depending on how many steam games you have it could take a long time to build this index.

### `steam_game_cache_file`
- Type: String

A list of regular expressions to exclude from the steam games list. This is appended to the built in exclusions.
